# Recent projects quick opener

A simple plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that allows you to quickly search and open recent projects using the "Search Everywhere" interface.

## Features

-   **Search Everywhere Integration**: Adds a "Recent Projects" tab to the Search Everywhere dialog.
-   **Quick Access**: Quickly filter and find the project you are looking for.
-   **Context Aware**: Automatically filters out the currently open project from the list.
-   **Helpful Display**: Shows project names and paths relative to your user home directory.

## Usage

Use the keyboard shortcut `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `P` to directly open the Recent Projects search.

Alternatively, open "Search Everywhere" (Project defaults: `Double Shift`) and navigate to the "Recent Projects" tab.
